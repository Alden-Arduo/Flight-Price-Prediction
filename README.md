# Flight-Price-Prediction

Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyse an booking flight dataset then build a machine learning model to predict the price of a flight. The dataset comes from a website called â€œEase My Trip" which is an online platform where potential passengers can book flight tickets.

Summary:
 - Data Exploration 
 - Data Preprocessing (One-hot encoding)
 - Model Training (Random Forest Regressor)
 - Model Evaluation (Model Metrics and Feature Importances)
 - Hyperparameter Tuning (Grid Search CV and Randomized Search CV)

Skills:
 - Python
 - Pandas
 - Machine Learning
 - Data Visualisation
 - Data Modelling
 - Data Cleaning
 - sklearn
 - matplotlib

The new model (with hyperparameter tuning) performs better than the old model (without hyperparamter tunning) in predicting flight prices.
